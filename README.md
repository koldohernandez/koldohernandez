### üëã Hi there 

#### I'm Software Engineer focused on backend technologies

Currently, I am part of the [Genial.ly](https://genial.ly) technology team as a Software Engineer. Specifically, I am on the backend team maintaining and improving the API, since the business is growing a lot and needs to handle a lot of traffic and be highly scalable.

Previously, I worked at the startup [Kimet Sport](https://www.kimetsport.com) as a Teach Lead and, due to the type of company, I was responsible for the coordination between business and development. Likewise, I was in charge of planning and coordinating the developments of the company, and my effort was focused on helping the team decide what to do and how to do it.

If you want to know more about me, feel free to get in touch with me ‚ù§Ô∏è
